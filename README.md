## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this project I learn on how to write HTML and CSS code since this is the first time I write it by own. For HTML, I learned what is the function, how and when need to use it of several element such as <div>, <section> and many more. I also learned how to make a responsive website by write code using CSS. I use @media(min-width : 1440px) in order to change the view of the website into desktob view if the size of the web is bigger then 1440px else the view will be in mobile view.
